**[🔗 Live Demo →](https://dascient.github.io/Plan-Examiner)**

Plan-Examiner is an agentic compliance reviewer that checks architectural drawings against building codes — IBC, ADA, and NFPA — and produces scored findings, citations, and correction letters. All document parsing and rule evaluation runs **client-side** in the browser. Nothing is uploaded to a server.

## Sample Projects & Local Demos

To test the application's performance and accuracy without using your own private plans, you can use these public-domain sample sets. They are categorized by complexity to help you test different aspects of the agentic pipeline.

| Project Type | Sample Set Name | Key Testing Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Large Scale** | [SRE Expansion (GRR Airport)](https://www.grr.org/hubfs/GFIAA_C378_SRE%20Expansion_Bid%20Set%20Drawings.pdf) | Large-format rendering & MEP schedules |
| **Industrial** | [Fuel Facility (GRR Airport)](https://www.grr.org/hubfs/GRR%20Fuel%20Facility%20Plans%20-%20Issued%20for%20Bid.pdf) | High-density vector line work |
| **Commercial** | [Naples Airport Office Building](https://www.flynaples.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-02-28-NAPLES-AOB-CONSTRUCTION-DRAWINGS.pdf) | Interior finishes & Life Safety plans |
| **Campus** | [UCCS Bid Set](https://pdc.uccs.edu/sites/g/files/kjihxj1346/files/inline-files/2021-0525_UCCS%20BID%20SET%20-%20Drawings.pdf) | Multi-page navigation & site topography |
| **Standard** | [City of Kirkland Sample Set](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/files/sharedassets/public/v/1/development-services/pdfs/building-pdfs/sample-construction-plan-set.pdf) | Baseline functional testing |

**How to run a demo:**
1. Download any of the PDFs above.
2. Open Plan-Examiner (Live or Local).
3. Drag and drop the file into the **Upload** zone.
4. Select a **Rule Pack** (e.g., ADA 2010 for the Office Building).
5. Click **"Start Review"** to trigger the 7-step agent pipeline.

## BYO-Key LLM Setup

Plan-Examiner works **fully offline** without an LLM — the rule engine is deterministic. Add a key to enable:
- AI-generated narrative summaries
- Correction letter drafting
- Chat Q&A ("Ask the reviewer")
- Ambiguous-rule reasoning

**How to configure:**
1. Click **AI Settings** in the navigation bar (or press `Ctrl+K → AI Settings`).
2. Select your provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, or local Ollama).
3. Paste your API key. It is stored only in your browser's `localStorage` — never transmitted to Plan-Examiner servers.

---

## Privacy

> **All document parsing, fact extraction, and rule evaluation runs entirely in your browser. No plan data is sent to any server under Plan-Examiner's control.**

The only outbound requests are:
- To CDN for font and library assets (Font Awesome, pdf.js, mammoth.js, Tailwind) on first load.
- To your configured LLM provider **only when you have added an API key** and triggered a summarization or chat action.
